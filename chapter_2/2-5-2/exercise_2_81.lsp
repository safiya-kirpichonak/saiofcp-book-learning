a. There will be an error because the operation is not defined for complex numbers.

b. I believe he is correct. The program indeed ignores the fact that the data 
types can be the same. I think everything works fine because if a variable 
has the required data type, type conversion will simply occur, and the 
operation will be performed. However, the function does not work perfectly, 
as it does not ignore two objects of the same type, and this unnecessary 
type conversion can be easily avoided.

c. I think the last condition just needs to be corrected:
(cond ((= type1 type2) (op a1 a2))
      (t1->t2 (apply-generic op (t1->t2 a1) a2))
      (t2->t1 (apply-generic op a1 (t2->t1 a2)))
      (else (error "No operation for these types" (list op type-tags))))))
