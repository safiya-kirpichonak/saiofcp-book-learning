Normal code:
(flatmap
    (lambda (rest-of-queens)
        (map (lambda (new-row) (adjoin-position new-row n rest-of-queens))
             (enumerate-interval 1 board-size)))
    (queen-columns (- n 1)))

Error code:
(flatmap
    (lambda (new-row)
            (map (lambda (rest-of-queens) (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
                 (queen-columns (- k 1)))) 
(enumerate-interval 1 board-size))

The error code works slowly because the flatmap and map operations create unnecessary 
nested iterations and recomputation for each potential position of queens. These extra 
iterations increase the time complexity, making the program inefficient. If the original 
program takes time `T`, the modified program will take significantly longer due to additional 
processing overhead from these operations.
