I already gave a detailed answer in the previous task. As for whether it's possible to create 
such a package, I think not, since this isn’t an algorithm issue but rather how computers 
fundamentally work. Although Python does provide mathematical libraries, it might be possible 
to achieve this with them or minimalize the precision error, but I haven’t tried.
