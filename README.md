# SAIOCP book [In progress]

I am reading the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs," and here are my answers. Most of them are completed in Lisp, while others are in JavaScript. I am completing all tasks except those in the "Example: ..." chapters.

## Installation (macOS)

We use lisp scheme dialect here. So if you don't have this, you can install it:

```
brew install mit-scheme
```

check version of lisp installed:

```
sbcl --version
```

## Usage

- install "Common Lisp" (qingpeng.common-lisp) extension for better view for Lisp.

- create lisp file with .scm or .lsp extension.

- run lisp file:

```
mit-scheme --load hello.lsp
```

## Instructions for folder 2-2-4

For this part of the book you need [Racket and tool DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/getting-started/). Download it and set up. next you need to install specific library "sicp". I will use "einstein" painter for all tasks, because "wave" and "rogers" don't work.
