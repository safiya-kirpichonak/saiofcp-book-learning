I am reading book "Structure and interpretation of computer programs" and here is my answers.

## Installation (macOS)

We use lisp scheme dialect here. So if you don't have this, you can install it:

```
brew install mit-scheme
```

check version of lisp installed:

```
sbcl --version
```

## Usage

- create lisp file with .scm extension

- run lisp file:

```
mit-scheme --load hello.scm
```
