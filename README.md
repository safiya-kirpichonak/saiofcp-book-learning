# SAIOCP book [In progress]

I am reading book "Structure and interpretation of computer programs" and here is my answers. Some of the
tasks I created with Lisp, other with Node.js.

## Installation (macOS)

We use lisp scheme dialect here. So if you don't have this, you can install it:

```
brew install mit-scheme
```

check version of lisp installed:

```
sbcl --version
```

## Usage

- install "Common Lisp" (qingpeng.common-lisp) extension for better view for Lisp. 

- create lisp file with .scm or .lsp extension.

- run lisp file:

```
mit-scheme --load hello.lsp
```
