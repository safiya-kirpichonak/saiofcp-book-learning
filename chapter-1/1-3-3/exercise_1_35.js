/**
 * golden ratio (Ï†) is just a special constant number, like PI, and its = 1.618.
 * 
 * The fixed point is a number that does not change when you put it in function. 
 * Imagine you found a number x so that if you put it in 1+1/x, the result will
 * be the same as x. For example, if you put x=1.618, the result of the function 
 * again will be about 1.618 - and this is a golden ratio.
 * 
 * fixedPoint is a function that looks for fixed points for any given function (f). 
 * It starts with the initial number (firstGuess) and applies the function again 
 * and again until the result is close enough (given the error set by TOLERANCE).
 * 
 * transformation function is itself a simple function. It is related to the golden 
 * section only because its fixed point is the golden section.
