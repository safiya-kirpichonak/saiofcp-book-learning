1. Call to apply-generic: When (magnitude z) is invoked, apply-generic determines the 
complex tag of the object z. This is achieved through dispatching, which directs 
execution to the package corresponding to the complex tag.

2. Processing in the complex package: In the complex package, the magnitude method 
accesses the appropriate representation of the number â€” in this case, the rectangular 
tag, as z is represented in rectangular form.

3. The rectangular package: In the rectangular package, the corresponding magnitude
function is called, which calculates the magnitude of the number based on its real
and imaginary parts.

Result:
- How many times is apply-generic called? Twice: first, when (magnitude z) is invoked 
to select the complex package, and second, when transitioning to the rectangular package.

- To which procedures does it dispatch? Initially, to the magnitude method in the complex 
package, and then to the magnitude method in the rectangular package.
