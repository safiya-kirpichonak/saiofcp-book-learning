1) The following changes will need to be made:

- Generic Operations with Explicit Dispatching: If we are introducing a new type, 
we will need to implement all the functions that already exist for other types to 
maintain consistency. Generic selectors will need to be updated to recognize the 
new data type. If we are introducing a new operation, we simply need to implement 
this operation for all existing data types.

- Data-Driven Style: If we are introducing a new type, we will need to create 
a package with internal functions and external interface functions. If we are 
introducing a new operation, a new external operation (and, if necessary, an 
internal one) must be created in each package.

- Message Passing: We will need to create a make function for the new 
type and specify within it the list of allowed internal operations. If a 
new operation needs to be implemented for all types, a new if statement 
with the name of the new operation must be added to the relevant functions 
for each type.

2 and 3) I think the best system among all of these is the data-driven 
style. It is better than "generic operations with explicit dispatching" 
because it encapsulates functions into packages that are resistant to 
naming conflicts, autonomous, and convenient for creating combinations 
and building multi-level abstractions, as long as the external interface 
is followed. It is also better than "message passing" because it is 
easier to understand: there is a package with internal and external 
functions, and you don’t have access to internal ones, meaning 
encapsulation is maintained—unlike with message passing, where it is not.

That said, message passing can be more useful if new types are frequently 
added and operations are rarely changed because the function approach is 
more compact and convenient than a package-based approach.
